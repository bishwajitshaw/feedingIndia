                        grants to individuals and NGOs so that we can help as many dogs as possible.</p>

                <li>feedingIndia is the world’s largest ecosystem of no-kill rescue, rehabilitation, and lifelong care for dogs, and the services that support it.</li>
                <li>It is a home for life for dogs who have no hope of surviving on the streets and we have the infrastructure to take care of ~1400 dogs all of which receive the best nutritional care, veterinary services, and lots of love and cuddles for the rest of their natural life.</li>
                <li>feedingIndia Sanctuary was founded on the principle that no dog will ever be euthanized because of lack of space, money, or resources.</li>
                <li>feedingIndia is home to not just India’s most ‘unadoptable’ dogs, but also of ‘Patriot Dogs’ — India’s service dogs who have been retired from the Karnataka Police, Reserve Police, Railway Police, Kerala Police and the Indian Army.</li>
                <li>We provide the world’s first remote medical assistance service for dogs wherein our vets read diagnostic reports remotely and recommend treatments for injured/ ill dogs.</li>
                <li>feedingIndia has created a series of firsts, including the world’s first mobile app for dog rescue and custom CRM to boost rescue and treatment operations. We have also created India’s first blood bank for stray and pet dogs.</li>
